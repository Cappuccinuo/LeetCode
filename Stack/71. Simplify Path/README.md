GIVEN: Given an **absolute path** for a file (Unix-style)

RETURNS: **canonical path**

Note: Note that the returned canonical path must always begin with a slash `/`, and there must be only a single slash `/` between two directory names. The last directory name (if it exists) **must not** end with a trailing `/`. Also, the canonical path must be the **shortest**string representing the absolute path.

EXAMPLES:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: "/a/./b/../../c/"
Output: "/c"
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: "/a/../../b/../c//.//"
Output: "/c"
```

**Example 6:**

```
Input: "/a//b////c/d//././/.."
Output: "/a/b/c"
```

Algorithm:

Stack.

We can first split the path by "/". When come up with "." and "", we continue, with "..", we pop one from stack. Otherwise push to stack.
