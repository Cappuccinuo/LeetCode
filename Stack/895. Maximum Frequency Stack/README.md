Implement `FreqStack`, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like data structure.

`FreqStack` has two functions:

- `push(int x)`, which pushes an integer `x` onto the stack.

- ```
  pop()
  ```

  , which removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.

  - If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.

EXAMPLES:

```
Input: 
["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"],
[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]
Explanation:
After making six .push operations, the stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5] from bottom to top.  Then:

pop() -> returns 5, as 5 is the most frequent.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top.
The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].

pop() -> returns 5.
The stack becomes [5,7,4].

pop() -> returns 4.
The stack becomes [5,7].
```

Algorithm:

We need to keep track of val's frequency, and also maintain a sturcture to store the previous max. So using a key-integer, val-stack<Integer> hashmap.
