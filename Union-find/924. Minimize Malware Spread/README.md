GIVEN: An adjacency matrix. grid\[i][j] = 1 means i and j are connected. And a initial malware nodes.

RETURNS: We will remove one node from the initial list.  Return the node that if removed, would minimize `M(initial)`.  If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize `M(initial)`, return such a node with the smallest index.

EXAMPLES: 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,1]
Output: 0
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: graph = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,2]
Output: 0
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: graph = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], initial = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

Algorithm:

Using union find to union all the nodes connected.

Then traverse the initial list, for each node, we compare the size of its union set and the maximum size union set. If its size > max currently, we update the index as it. If the size is equal, we pick the minimum index.
