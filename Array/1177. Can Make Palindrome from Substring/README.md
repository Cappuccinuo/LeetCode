GIVEN: Given a string `s`, we make queries on substrings of `s`.

RETURNS: 

For each query `queries[i] = [left, right, k]`, we may **rearrange** the substring `s[left], ..., s[right]`, and then choose **up to** `k` of them to replace with any lowercase English letter. 

If the substring is possible to be a palindrome string after the operations above, the result of the query is `true`. Otherwise, the result is `false`.

Return an array `answer[]`, where `answer[i]` is the result of the `i`-th query `queries[i]`.

EXAMPLES:

```
Input: s = "abcda", queries = [[3,3,0],[1,2,0],[0,3,1],[0,3,2],[0,4,1]]
Output: [true,false,false,true,true]
Explanation:
queries[0] : substring = "d", is palidrome.
queries[1] : substring = "bc", is not palidrome.
queries[2] : substring = "abcd", is not palidrome after replacing only 1 character.
queries[3] : substring = "abcd", could be changed to "abba" which is palidrome. Also this can be changed to "baab" first rearrange it "bacd" then replace "cd" with "ab".
queries[4] : substring = "abcda", could be changed to "abcba" which is palidrome.
```

Algorithm:

The trick part is how to avoid TLE. As for each substring, we need to quickly find if we can **rearrange** and make the best use of current substring. 

Similar to many array problem, we can use prefixSum. For specific range we can compare each character, to see if this character is odd or even. Count the odd character, and compare count/2 with query[2].
