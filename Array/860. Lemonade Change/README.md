Time spent :  30 min(Self During Contest)

GIVEN: a lemonade stand, each cost $5

RETURNS: true iff you can provide every customer with correct change

Note: Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a `$5`, `$10`, or `$20` bill.  You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

EXAMPLES:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true
Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all customers got correct change, we output true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [5,5,10]
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [10,10]
Output: false
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: [5,5,10,10,20]
Output: false
Explanation: 
From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
For the last customer, we can't give change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
Since not every customer received correct change, the answer is false.
```

Algorithm:

If customer bring $5, take it.

If bring $10, check if we have five dollar. 

If bring $20, check if we have one ten and one five, or three fives.
