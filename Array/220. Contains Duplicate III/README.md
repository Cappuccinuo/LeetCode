GIVEN: Given an array of integers

RETURNS: whether there are two distinct indices *i* and *j* in the array such that the **absolute** difference between **nums[i]** and **nums[j]** is at most *t* and the **absolute** difference between *i* and *j* is at most *k*.

EXAMPLES:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
Output: false
```
