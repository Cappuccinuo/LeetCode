GIVEN: given a matrix with `R` rows and `C` columns has cells with integer coordinates `(r, c)`, where `0 <= r < R` and `0 <= c < C`.

Additionally, we are given a cell in that matrix with coordinates `(r0, c0)`.

RETURNS: Return the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their distance from `(r0, c0)` from smallest distance to largest distance.  (Manhattan)

EXAMPLES:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: R = 1, C = 2, r0 = 0, c0 = 0
Output: [[0,0],[0,1]]
Explanation: The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: R = 2, C = 2, r0 = 0, c0 = 1
Output: [[0,1],[0,0],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2]
The answer [[0,1],[1,1],[0,0],[1,0]] would also be accepted as correct.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: R = 2, C = 3, r0 = 1, c0 = 2
Output: [[1,2],[0,2],[1,1],[0,1],[1,0],[0,0]]
Explanation: The distances from (r0, c0) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2,2,3]
There are other answers that would also be accepted as correct, such as [[1,2],[1,1],[0,2],[1,0],[0,1],[0,0]].
```

Algorithm:

BFS from original points.
