Design a data structure that supports all following operations in *average* **O(1)** time.

1. `insert(val)`: Inserts an item val to the set if not already present.
2. `remove(val)`: Removes an item val from the set if present.
3. `getRandom`: Returns a random element from current set of elements. Each element must have the **same probability** of being returned.

**Example:**

```
// Init an empty set.
RandomizedSet randomSet = new RandomizedSet();

// Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
randomSet.insert(1);

// Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
randomSet.remove(2);

// Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
randomSet.insert(2);

// getRandom should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
randomSet.getRandom();

// Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
randomSet.remove(1);

// 2 was already in the set, so return false.
randomSet.insert(2);

// Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom always return 2.
randomSet.getRandom();
```

Algorithm:

We can maintain a hashmap and list, the list is used to contain values, and the map record the position of the val. When we delete a val, we find its index, to acheive O(1), we exchange it with the last number in list, then delete the last one of list.
