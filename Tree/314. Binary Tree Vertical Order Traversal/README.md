GIVEN: Given a binary tree

RETURNS: the *vertical order* traversal of its nodes' values. 

EXAMPLES:

**Examples 1:**

```
Input: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

   3
  /\
 /  \
 9  20
    /\
   /  \
  15   7 

Output:

[
  [9],
  [3,15],
  [20],
  [7]
]
```

**Examples 2:**

```
Input: [3,9,8,4,0,1,7]

     3
    /\
   /  \
   9   8
  /\  /\
 /  \/  \
 4  01   7 

Output:

[
  [4],
  [9],
  [3,0,1],
  [8],
  [7]
]
```

**Examples 3:**

```
Input: [3,9,8,4,0,1,7,null,null,null,2,5] (0's right child is 2 and 1's left child is 5)

     3
    /\
   /  \
   9   8
  /\  /\
 /  \/  \
 4  01   7
    /\
   /  \
   5   2

Output:

[
  [4],
  [9,5],
  [3,0,1],
  [8,2],
  [7]
]
```

Algorithm:

We need to know how to tell if two node are in the same vertical level. 

if root's vertical level is 0, then its left is -1, its right is 1. So we need a hashmap to maintain each node's vertical level, and also a hashmap to maintain each vertical level's list.
