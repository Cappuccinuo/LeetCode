Time spent :  1 min(self)

GIVEN: root node of BST and a val

RETURNS: The subtree rooted with that node

EXAMPLES:

```
Given the tree:
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \
    1   3

And the value to search: 2
```

You should return this subtree:

```
      2     
     / \   
    1   3
```

Algorithm:

Use the property of BST
