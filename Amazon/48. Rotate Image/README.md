Time spent : 20 min (Self + see hint)

GIVEN: n*n 2D matrix representing an image

EFFECT: rotate the image by 90 degrees clockwise

**Example 1:**

```
Given input matrix = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given input matrix =
[
  [ 5, 1, 9,11],
  [ 2, 4, 8,10],
  [13, 3, 6, 7],
  [15,14,12,16]
], 

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [15,13, 2, 5],
  [14, 3, 4, 1],
  [12, 6, 8, 9],
  [16, 7,10,11]
]
```



Common ways:

```
/*
 * clockwise rotate
 * first reverse up to down, then swap the symmetry 
 * 1 2 3     7 8 9     7 4 1
 * 4 5 6  => 4 5 6  => 8 5 2
 * 7 8 9     1 2 3     9 6 3
 * or first transpose the matrix, then flip it symmetrically
 * 1 2 3     1 4 7     7 4 1
 * 4 5 6  => 2 5 8  => 8 5 2
 * 7 8 9     3 6 9     9 6 3
*/
```

```
/*
 * anticlockwise rotate
 * first reverse left to right, then swap the symmetry
 * 1 2 3     3 2 1     3 6 9
 * 4 5 6  => 6 5 4  => 2 5 8
 * 7 8 9     9 8 7     1 4 7
