Solution : Stack

GIVEN: a list of strings

RETURNS: the sum of the points could get in all the rounds

EXAMPLES:

```
Input: ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation: 
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get 2 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 2's data was invalid. The sum is: 5.  
Round 3: You could get 10 points (the round 2's data has been removed). The sum is: 15.
Round 4: You could get 5 + 10 = 15 points. The sum is: 30.

Input: ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
Output: 27
Explanation: 
Round 1: You could get 5 points. The sum is: 5.
Round 2: You could get -2 points. The sum is: 3.
Round 3: You could get 4 points. The sum is: 7.
Operation 1: The round 3's data is invalid. The sum is: 3.  
Round 4: You could get -4 points (the round 3's data has been removed). The sum is: -1.
Round 5: You could get 9 points. The sum is: 8.
Round 6: You could get -4 + 9 = 5 points. The sum is 13.
Round 7: You could get 9 + 5 = 14 points. The sum is 27.
```

DESIGN STRATEGY: Stack



1. Different scenerio of C D + and number
2. C : stack.pop()
3. D : stack.push(stack.peek() * 2)
4. \+ : first pop the top one, than calculate the sum of this number and the peek one. push it back, and push the sum.
5. String -> Integer : Integer.parseInt(s)
