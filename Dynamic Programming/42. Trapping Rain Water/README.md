Time spent : 10 min(self + see hint of last solution)

GIVEN: a non-negative integers representing an elevation map

RETURNS: how much water it is able to trap after raining

```
Given [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1], return 6.
```





Solution 1 : 

Brute force. For each element in the array, find the maximum level of water it can trap, which is equal to the minimum of maximum height of bars on both the sides minus its own height.

Solution 2 :

Instead iterate each element's rightmost and leftmost, we can store the left_most and right_most in two arrays. 

- Find maximum height of bar from the left end upto an index i in the array left_max.
- Find maximum height of bar from the right end upto an index i in the array right_max.
- Iterate over the height array and update ans:
- Add min(max_left[i],max_right[i])âˆ’height[i] to ansans
