GIVEN: trust array every pair trust[i] = [a,b] represent a trust b, and N

RETURNS: the judge

Note: If the town judge exists, then:

1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

EXAMPLES:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: -1
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: N = 4, trust = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]
Output: 3
```

Algorithm:

Same idea with 277. Find the celebrity.

Except we need to construct the knows array by ourself.

Instead we can view this as a directed graph problem, the judge must have N-1 incoming degree.
