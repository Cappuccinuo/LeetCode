Solution 1 : Recursion (Parent Variant)

This problem cannot be solved by DP, cause it is too large when N become big.

![](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-th-symbol-in-grammar/Figures/779/link.png)

We can see that the parent of given K, is (K + 1) / 2 in last row. For example, N = 4, K = 5, parent is N = 3, K = 3, which is 1. We can also see, on the left half, the pattern is exactly same as last row. So when the parent is 0, the digit will be same as 1 - (K % 2), if the parent is 1, the digit will be K % 2.

Note: K & 1 : judge if a number is odd. ~K & 1 : judge if a number is even.

When parent is 0, if K is odd, result is 1, if K is even, result is 0.

â€‹			   1, if K is odd, result is 0, if K is even, result is 1.

So we can use ^ to achieve the goal, cause 1 ^ 0 = 1, 0 ^ 0 = 0.

Parent digit can be called by recursive, kthGrammar(N - 1, (K + 1) / 2). Operate ^ with (~K & 1)
