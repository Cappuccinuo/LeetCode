GIVEN: There are *n* bulbs that are initially off.

RETURNS: Find how many bulbs are on after *n* rounds.

EXAMPLES:

```
Input: 3
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 

So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.

A bulb ends up on iff it is switched an odd number of times.

Call them bulb 1 to bulb n. Bulb i is switched in round d if and only if d divides i. So bulb i ends up on if and only if it has an odd number of divisors.

Divisors come in pairs, like i=12 has divisors 1 and 12, 2 and 6, and 3 and 4. Except when i is a square, like 36 has divisors 1 and 36, 2 and 18, 3 and 12, 4 and 9, and double divisor 6. So bulb i ends up on if and only if i is a square.

**So just count the square numbers.**

Let R = int(sqrt(n)). That's the root of the largest square in the range [1,n]. And 1 is the smallest root. So you have the roots from 1 to R, that's R roots. Which correspond to the R squares. So int(sqrt(n)) is the answer.
