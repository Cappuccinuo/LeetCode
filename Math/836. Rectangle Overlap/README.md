GIVEN: two rectangles 

RETURNS: true if they overlap

Note: A rectangle is represented as a list `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where `(x1, y1)` are the coordinates of its bottom-left corner, and `(x2, y2)` are the coordinates of its top-right corner.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]
Output: false
```



We can think when the two rectangles not overlap.
