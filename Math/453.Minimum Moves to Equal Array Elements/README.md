Time spent : 10 min (see hint)

GIVEN: a non-empty integer array of size n

RETURNS: minimum number of moves required to make all array element equal

Note: the move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.

EXAMPLES:

```
Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
```
