Time spent : 10 min (See hint)

GIVEN: an Integer

RETURNS: Roman string

EXAMPLES:

Input: 

```
45
```

Output: "XLV"

DESIGN STRATEGY: 

Cause the roman representation of 900, 400, 40,â€¦ is different, in other condition, is just append. So we list all the possible combination component and corresponding number.

Go through the numArr, while (num >= numArr[i]), we keep add the strArr[i] to the result, and substract numArr[i] from num.
