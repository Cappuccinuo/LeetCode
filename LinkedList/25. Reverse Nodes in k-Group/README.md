GIVEN: a linked list

RETURNS: reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list

Note: *k* is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of *k* then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

EXAMPLES:

Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`

For *k* = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`

For *k* = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`

Algorithm:
