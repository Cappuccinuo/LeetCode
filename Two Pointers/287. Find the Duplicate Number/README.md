Time spent : 15 min (Self)

GIVEN: an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive)

RETURNS: the duplicate number

EXAMPLES:

Input: 

```
nums = [1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 3]
```

Output: 3

DESIGN STRATEGY: Two Pointers



1. First sort the array.
2. Two pointers lo and hi . Compare nums[lo] and nums[lo + 1] as well as nums[hi] and nums[hi - 1]. If the same, return nums[lo] or nums[hi]. Otherwise, lo++, hiâ€”.
