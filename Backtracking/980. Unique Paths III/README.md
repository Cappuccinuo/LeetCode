GIVEN: 2d grid

Note: 

- `1` represents the starting square.  There is exactly one starting square.
- `2` represents the ending square.  There is exactly one ending square.
- `0` represents empty squares we can walk over.
- `-1` represents obstacles that we cannot walk over.

RETURNS:

The number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that **walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once**.

EXAMPLES:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,2,-1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We have the following two paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2)
2. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2)
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,2]]
Output: 4
Explanation: We have the following four paths: 
1. (0,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)
2. (0,0),(0,1),(1,1),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
3. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(2,3)
4. (0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(2,1),(1,1),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,3),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3)
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [[0,1],[2,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: 
There is no path that walks over every empty square exactly once.
Note that the starting and ending square can be anywhere in the grid.
```

Algorithm:

First calculate the free position number, record start and end point.

In Backtracking, if the x and y is out of bound, or grid\[x][y] is smaller than 0, return.

If x is end x, y is end y and free is 0, ans++.

main part of backtracking is easy to understand, we flag visited point as -2, meantime we subtract 2 from free.

Traverse the 4 direction, and add free back, restore grid position as 0.

Notice that free is init as 1, cause starting point is also an empty position.
